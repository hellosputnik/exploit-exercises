# Level15

strace the binary at /home/flag15/flag15 and see if you spot anything out of the ordinary.

You may wish to review how to “compile a shared library in linux” and how the libraries are loaded and processed by reviewing the dlopen manpage in depth.

Clean up after yourself :)

To do this level, log in as the level15 account with the password level15. Files for this level can be found in /home/flag15.
